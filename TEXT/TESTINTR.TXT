TESTING

This section documents the tests which were carried out on the program, to prove that it meets with the requirements set out when the system was designed.

The tests follow very closely the test plan which was devised during the design. In fact, the separate sub-sections used in the test plan are used again here. 

For each sub-section, a table with three columns has been produced. 

The first column is simply the number of the test. This can be used to identify the test in the test plan. 

The second is a comment on the test. For many tests, this is left blank. This simply means that the test worked as documented in the test plan.

The third is a reference number for any evidence given. In most cases, this evidence is in the form of a screen dump of the program in action. However, for some tests, a screen dump is not appropriate, and therefore no evidence is provided.

Finally, after all the tables and screen dumps, a note on compatibility is given, followed by a summary of the success of the testing.
COMPATIBILITY

To check the compatibility of the software, it was tested on the Nimbus system discussed in the design.

All the tests proved positive. 

The screen display worked perfectly on both EGA and VGA settings, as did the mouse.

The file-handling functions coped with the hard disk equally well, and the only bearing the 80286 processor had on the software was to speed it up, as expected.

The printouts produced by the EPSON LQ-850 were identical to those produced by the STAR, as they should be. One of these printouts, by means of evidence, is given overleaf.

Finally, the system was tested using a STAR LC-10C 9-pin printer, which worked as expected. The results of these tests were given earlier.


SUMMARY

All in all, the software could not have responded more favourably to the tests applied to it. 

The system is now without doubt fully operational.
